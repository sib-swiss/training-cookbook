# Course Evaluation 

Evaluating the course is about gaining an understanding of what your students have learned and assessing what specific learning activities, assignments, resources, texts, conversations, deliveries, etc. may have been significant contributors to that learning. Assessment can also shed light on the gaps in student learning, in our teaching goals and learning outcomes, and which steps can be undertaken to address those gaps. 

As much as possible, assessment should be varied and occur at multiple points throughout the course and once it is finished. The ELIXIR-GOBLET Train-the-Trainer courses provide information on how to assess the students' progress during a course. The following are sources of data to evaluate a course after it has taken place that are used by the SIB Training: 

- The [Short-Term Feedback](https://sib-swiss.github.io/training-cookbook/procedure/feedback/) form: at the end of each course, the participants are asked to provide their feedback on the quality and pertinence of the content, on the delivery of the course, and on the trainers. The output of this feedback should be used for the next iteration of the course.  
- Debrief of **#Trainers**, **#Helpers**, **#Manager**: at the end of each course, those involved meet to discuss the points to improve on the content, delivery, organisation, etc. 
- Previous iterations: it is important to check with previous coordinators of a course and trainers if there is anything to consider before a course takes place. 
- Grades: Review how well students perform on their exams, and other learning activities. 
- Collection of Short-Term Feedback: once a year, the answers from all the Short-Term Feedback forms from all past courses, in a given timeframe, are compiled into one single file. This compilation can indicate the missing topics that can be addressed when we create the programme of the next year, but it does not provide an evaluation of the courses.
- [Long-Term Feedback](https://sib-swiss.github.io/training-cookbook/procedure/admin_tasks/) form: six or twelve months after the courses have taken place, we collect information on impact that course had on the participants - did they apply what they have learned, did they teach what they have learned,etc. of the course is normally done when planning the courses of the next year.
