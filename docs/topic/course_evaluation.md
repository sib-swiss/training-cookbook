# Course Evaluation 

Evaluating a course involves understanding what students have learned and identifying which specific learning activities, assignments, resources, texts, conversations, and deliveries significantly contributed to that learning. Assessment can also highlight gaps in student learning, teaching goals, and learning outcomes, and suggest steps to address those gaps.

Assessment should be varied and occur at multiple points throughout the course and after it is finished. The (ELIXIR-GOBLET Train-the-Trainer (TtT) Course)[https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/training/train-the-trainer] provides guidance on assessing students' progress during a course. The following are sources of data used by SIB Training to evaluate a course after it has taken place:

- **Short-Term Feedback Form**: At the end of each course, participants provide feedback on the quality and relevance of the content, the delivery of the course, and the trainers. This feedback is used for the next iteration of the course. [Short-Term Feedback](https://sib-swiss.github.io/training-cookbook/procedure/feedback/) 
- **Debrief of Trainers, Helpers, and Manager**: After each course, those involved meet to discuss improvements in content, delivery, organization, etc.
- **Previous Iterations**: It is important to check with previous coordinators and trainers for any considerations before a course takes place.
- **Grades**: Reviewing student performance on exams and other learning activities.
- **Collection of Short-Term Feedback**: Once a year, answers from all Short-Term Feedback forms from past courses are compiled into a single file. This compilation can indicate missing topics to address in the next year's program but does not provide a course evaluation.
- **Long-Term Feedback Form**: Six or twelve months after the courses, we collect information on the impact the course had on participantsâ€”whether they applied what they learned, taught it to others, etc. This feedback is used when planning the next year's courses.
