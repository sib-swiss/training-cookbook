# Course design 

A good place to start is to recommend that the trainer follows the [ELIXIR-GOBLET Train-the-Trainer (TtT) Course](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/training/train-the-trainer). A second step would be to consider reading the materials of the [TtT Course](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT). 

Four core topics form the basis the [TtT Course](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT) structure:

- Principles of learning and how they apply to training;
- Training techniques for enhancing learner engagement and participation,
- Design of engaging sessions, materials and courses;
- Assessment and feedback in training and teaching.
