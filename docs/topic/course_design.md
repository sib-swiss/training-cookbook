# Course design 


### Course Design


A good starting point for trainers is to follow the [ELIXIR-GOBLET Train-the-Trainer (TtT) Course](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/training/train-the-trainer). Additionally, reading the materials provided in the [TtT Course](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT) can be highly beneficial.

The [TtT Course](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT) is structured around four core topics:

1. **Principles of Learning**: Understanding how learning principles apply to training.
2. **Training Techniques**: Enhancing learner engagement and participation.
3. **Design of Sessions, Materials, and Courses**: Creating engaging and effective training sessions and materials.
4. **Assessment and Feedback**: Implementing effective assessment and feedback methods in training and teaching.
