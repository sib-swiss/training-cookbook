# Identify and assess training needs 

SIB has as one of its two missions to develop the bioinformatics skills and competences of bioinformaticians, life and health scientists, nationally and internationally, from academia and industry, **by providing high quality training**. SIB Training courses are designed to closely match the bioinformatics training needs of our audiences. Identifying and assessing training needs is thus a very important task for the Training group, which will determine, influence and define the whole annual program.   


Several types of needs and requests are accessed before the annual program of courses can be composed. These needs are gathered from: 

- The feedback received from **#Participants** attending our courses
- The analysis of the coursesâ€™ metrics held in the previous years
- The feedback received from the Training Advisory Committee
- Ideas and requests from Group Leaders, PIs, etc
- The "Call for new courses", done normally once a year
- And special or emerging topics that are of interest to SIB 

The feedback received from **#Participants** is collected at the end of each course via the Short-Term Feedback survey ([see Short-Term Feedback form - how to make one](https://sib-training.gitlab.io/sib-training-cookbook/procedure/feedback/)). Two types of information are collected in the feedback surveys: 

A list of topics is supplied which the course **#Participants** can select as being of interest (more than 1 topic can be selected). This provides a count - number of times a course participant who has filled out the feedback expresses interest in a topic. This choice of topics is reviewed whenever necessary (every 3-5 years). 

Free text comments by the course **#Participants** may emphasize topics which were already in the list or suggest other topics. This also provides a count of the number of times a course participant who has filled out the feedback expresses interest in a topic.
