# ECTS credits and Exam 

## How to calculate ECTS credits – rules adopted in July 2014

Trying to better align with the European Community rules of ECTS attribution, and for the sake of clarity and coherence within SIB, and between SIB and its partner universities, we have defined some internal rules that are summarised as the following: 

1. A 1-day SIB workshop/course is worth 0.25 ECTS. SIB workshops/courses spanning 2, 3 or 4 days are worth 0.5, 0.75 or 1 ECTS respectively. In the case of substantial extra work (post-reports, preparing reading material, exercises, etc.), the equivalent workload will be calculated and indicated accordingly. 

2. A 5-day SIB workshop/course is worth 1.5 ECTS (5 x 0.25, and 0.25 for self-study during that week). In the case of substantial extra work (post-reports, preparing reading material, exercises, etc.), it can be worth 2 ECTS. 

3. The associated credits will be recommended after successful assessment, validation or recognition of the learning outcomes by the trainers. 

4. Without an evaluation or assessment, the SIB will award a certificate of attendance indicating the workload (number of hours, types of activities). With an evaluation or assessment, the SIB will award a certificate of "successfully passing" indicating the workload (number of hours, types of activities) and recommending the number of ECTS. 

Our exams are a nice to have step in our courses. With that we are making a favor for the students and their universities. On the other hand, it’s very good for our image - we are recognized by them as reliable partners. 

To recap, 1 ECTS in Switzerland (and in most [European countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System)) is worth 25-30 hours of effort - the "volume of learning based on the defined learning outcomes and their associated workload". 

In a regular day of course at SIB, we start at 9h and end around 17h. If we remove 1 hour for lunch and 30’ for coffee-breaks, we count 6.50 hours in total. And if we divide by 25 – 30 hours, we have a range of 0.26 - 0.21 ECTS, which we simplify to 0.25 ECTS per day of course. You can see that we have a little margin (25-30 hours) on this calculation, and that margin is used for the time spent on the exam.  

The minimum required to give this 0.25 credit is that the participants attend the course, but we go a little further, and check as well if they 1) “listened” and going even further if they 2) are able to achieve the learning outcomes. We are not obliged to go up to 2. We do it because we are good teachers and reliable partners.  But we can’t and we don’t want to go over **0.25 ECTS** per day of teaching/workload.  

So we **can’t and we don’t want** to ask participants to do an exam that would take longer than 30’ (7 hours / 25 = 0.28 (!) – 7 hours / 30 = 0.23) per day of course.  

### Exam corrections:
the longer the exam, the longer it takes for learners to do the exam, and to trainers to correct. And all the chain is on hold (our **#Admin** and **#Participant** waiting for certificates).  

Other rules:  

- For a **#Participant**: an exam shouldn’t take more than 30’ per day of course. Make it simple(r)!  
- For **#Participant**: No more than 48 hours to send the exam back to teachers 
- For **#Trainers**: No more than 48 hours for the teachers to send back the results to the **#Manager** and **#Admin** 
- The certificates should be sent to the **#Participant** at latest 2 weeks after the end of a course! 

### Types of exams
that can be discussed with the **#Trainers**: 

- Multiple-choice: are good options for courses with some Theory, and that are repeated often. 
- Extra-exercise/activity: It should be an exercise that will not take much time to be corrected. 
- Sometimes the **#Trainers** correct together an exercise with the students that are interested in the credits, doing a follow up and extra oral questions. 
- Oral exam at the end of the course 

 

**With or without ECTS credits – who decides**

It’s not mandatory that a SIB course has ECTS associated to it. It’s recommended but not mandatory. Providing ECTS requires extra work from the **#Trainer**, the **#Trainer** has thus the right to decide if the course will have ECTS.  

**Who validates the ECTS credits for the #Participant**

For SIB courses with an evaluation, we deliver certificates with the number of ECTS credits for those who succeeded in the assessment. Then, the **#Participant** can ask their university or PhD program to validate these credits according to their rules.
