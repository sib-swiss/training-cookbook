# Course plan
## Organize the course plan for the coming year 

The SIB usually develops 2-3 new e-learning courses every year. Possible topics are discussed with the Head of Training and may also be discussed at the Training Advisory Board meetings. 

 

E-learning courses require an expert **#Trainer** on the topic, to ensure that the content of the course is comprehensive and correct. This **#Trainer** must be contacted beforehand to ensure he/she will have time to discuss the content of the course prior to creating the course. 

 

 
## Design, Create, Improve and Evaluate a course 

E-learning courses follow a similar procedure to SIB Training courses (Design, Create, Improve and Evaluate a course). 

 


### Design the course 

For each new e-learning course, the topic, audience, competencies, learning objectives, and prerequisites should be established. 

- Competencies: A competency is *an observable ability of any professional*. A competency can be defined as a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes. It is observable, so its acquisition can be validated objectively. Competencies are currently being used only for e-leaning courses. 

- Each learning objective must align with a specific competency.

- Each task must ensure that the learning objective is met when completed.


E-learning courses on SIB resources generally follow a SIB Training course on the resource, for which a course description exists. 
 
The structure of the course should be designed with the **#Trainer** according to the length and level.

Each module should not take more than 1 hour to complete, as the **#Participant's** concentration begins to wane after 45 minutes. 





### Create the course 


E-learning courses follow a similar procedure to SIB Training courses (Course material page). 

The e-learning course is created in the SIB Bioinformatics Training and [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics E-learning Portal](https://edu.sib.swiss/), using the [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) LMS Learning Management System and [H5P](https://h5p.org/) for interactivity. A template is used for e-learning to ensure the same look and feel for most of the SIB e-learning courses. 

  

### Improve and adapt the content of the course 


The contents of e-learning courses on SIB resource are reviewed on a yearly basis and adapted to any modifications made. For example, changes to the URL of the resource or a complete redesign of the home page require the e-learning course content to be adapted. 

The content of the e-learning course is also improved based on the feedback form. 

 

 

### Evaluate the course 


As much as possible, the type of quiz should be varied and occur at multiple points throughout the e-learning course. Once finished, the student can view his/her score on the quizzes. 

As for SIB Training courses, e-learning course assessments can shed light on the gaps in student learning. It is thus especially important to provide additional information when the student has answered incorrectly to address these gaps, since there is no #Trainer on hand to answer questions. 

 

### Deliver the course 

For new e-learning courses, the #Trainer reviews the contents. A na√Øve student then takes the course to see if the level is adapted to the audience, the time it takes to complete the course, whether there are any bugs in the quizzes, etc. 

 

Once all the corrections to the course have been made, the e-learning course is made visible on Moodle. 

### Course description 

E-learning courses follow a similar procedure to SIB Training courses (Course description). 

 

The start date is set to the date when the e-learning course is made publicly available. The end date is set to December 31 of the current year. When the course is adapted and updated, this date is set to December 31 of the next calendar year. 

 

The Course location city or mode is set to E-Learning. 

 

The number of hours corresponds to the time it takes to complete the entire course. 

 

In the Description, the first section is always # About e-learning. This is followed by the same sections as found for the SIB Training courses, the # Overview through # Prerequisites. In some instances, a # Competencies section is found after # Audience. After the prerequisites, information specific to the e-learning course is provided, I.e. # Time required and # Instructions. In the instructions, links are directly to the H5P module. The last section #  Additional information is adapted to e-learning courses which do not have an organizer, do not provide ECTS credits and in which the ELIXIR Code of Conduct does not apply. 

 

 

### Feedback Form 


E-learning courses follow a similar procedure to SIB Training courses (Feedback Form) except that the feedback form for e-learning courses has been simplified. It includes the questions for the ELIXIR metrics (even though these are currently not being collected for e-learning courses) and some questions concerning the content of the course to determine whether improvements should be made.
