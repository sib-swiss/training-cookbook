# E-learning Coodination



### Deliver the course 

For new e-learning courses, the #Trainer reviews the contents. A na√Øve student then takes the course to see if the level is adapted to the audience, the time it takes to complete the course, whether there are any bugs in the quizzes, etc. 

 

Once all the corrections to the course have been made, the e-learning course is made visible on Moodle. 

### Course description 

E-learning courses follow a similar procedure to SIB Training courses (Course description). 

 

The start date is set to the date when the e-learning course is made publicly available. The end date is set to December 31 of the current year. When the course is adapted and updated, this date is set to December 31 of the next calendar year. 

 

The Course location city or mode is set to E-Learning. 

 

The number of hours corresponds to the time it takes to complete the entire course. 

 

In the Description, the first section is always # About e-learning. This is followed by the same sections as found for the SIB Training courses, the # Overview through # Prerequisites. In some instances, a # Competencies section is found after # Audience. After the prerequisites, information specific to the e-learning course is provided, I.e. # Time required and # Instructions. In the instructions, links are directly to the H5P module. The last section #  Additional information is adapted to e-learning courses which do not have an organizer, do not provide ECTS credits and in which the ELIXIR Code of Conduct does not apply. 

 

 

### Feedback Form 


E-learning courses follow a similar procedure to SIB Training courses (Feedback Form) except that the feedback form for e-learning courses has been simplified. It includes the questions for the ELIXIR metrics (even though these are currently not being collected for e-learning courses) and some questions concerning the content of the course to determine whether improvements should be made.
