# E-learning evaluation


 

### Evaluate the course 


As much as possible, the type of quiz should be varied and occur at multiple points throughout the e-learning course. Once finished, the student can view his/her score on the quizzes. 

As for SIB Training courses, e-learning course assessments can shed light on the gaps in student learning. It is thus especially important to provide additional information when the student has answered incorrectly to address these gaps, since there is no #Trainer on hand to answer questions. 

### Feedback Form 


E-learning courses follow a similar procedure to SIB Training courses (Feedback Form) except that the feedback form for e-learning courses has been simplified. It includes the questions for the ELIXIR metrics (even though these are currently not being collected for e-learning courses) and some questions concerning the content of the course to determine whether improvements should be made.
