# Course plan
## Organize the course plan for the coming year 

The SIB usually develops 2-3 new e-learning courses every year. Possible topics are discussed with the Head of Training and may also be discussed at the Training Advisory Board meetings. 

 

E-learning courses require an expert **#Trainer** on the topic, to ensure that the content of the course is comprehensive and correct. This **#Trainer** must be contacted beforehand to ensure he/she will have time to discuss the content of the course prior to creating the course.
