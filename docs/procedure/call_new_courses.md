# Call for new SIB courses
## Become a SIB Trainer on your favourite bioinformatics topic!


SIB provides training for researchers as part of its mission to accelerate research and innovation. The SIB Training Group organises over 60 courses annually targeting PhD students, postdoctoral and other
researchers in life sciences in collaboration with SIB experts and trainers. This collaborative approach ensures that our courses are delivered by knowledgeable and experienced experts in their respective
fields. With their emphasis on hands-on exercises, SIB courses are immensely popular, and many are oversubscribed.

We continuously monitor the evolving needs of the scientific community, looking for experts to teach new, leading-edge topics to expand the SIB Training portfolio. We are looking for trainers for courses we
plan to propose in 2024 such as applications of AI in life sciences, GWAS, multi-omics, single-cell technologies.

Are you working on one of these topics or at the cutting edge of a field in bioinformatics? Do you like to teach and share your knowledge with others? If so, we would love to hear from you. You will find more information below if you are interested in collaborating with us on this initiative. 

Let’s develop and provide training on the latest bioinformatic methods and data for the scientific community together!

### What you gain
- Professional training support to reach out to a broad audience and coordinate the course
- Refine your instructional, leadership and communication abilities, and/or let new members acquire these new skills by involving them as course assistants

- Relevance to the target audience

- Educational value and effectiveness of the proposed presentation approach and FAIRness of the data, tools and content
- Expertise of the trainers

### Responsibilities
**SIB Training Group will be responsible for:**

- Announcing the detailed course description of the upcoming SIB courses page on the SIB’s website (2 months before the course takes place).
- Advertising on SIB Training social media (based on material/information received from the trainers).
- Providing a meeting venue with necessary technical equipment and catering services during coffee breaks for the in person courses.
- Providing a spot in an [ELIXIR-GOBLET Train-the-Trainer course](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/ELIXIR-EXCELERATE-TtT) to improve your teaching skills.
- Providing support to make your training materials open and FAIR.

**Course trainers will be responsible for:**

- Finalising the course description, detailed schedule and providing material by the specific course deadlines (3 months before the course takes place).
- Compiling and distributing material to the participants (before or during the course).
- Leading and teaching the training at the defined time frame.
- Ensuring that the course materials are legally used, and that appropriate [copyright permissions](https://zenodo.org/records/5840175) have been arranged.
- Guaranteeing that course materials are as much as possible [open and FAIR](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854). Trainers agree that their material may be made available in any form (at least a month in advance, the latest at the start of the course) on the SIB [Training website](https://www.sib.swiss/training/training-materials).


### Rules
- SIB Training Group reserves the right to cancel a scheduled course, in agreement with the trainers, if registration one month before the course is less than 15 participants.
- All the in-person courses will take place onsite in Switzerland. To foster exchanges and interactivity during the sessions, participants, organisers and presenters must be present in-person.
- SIB Training Group will pay for travel and accommodation costs for a maximum of three trainers travelling within Switzerland for the in person courses.
- The SIB group teaching will receive 600 CHF per day of course.

#### How we will implement the last rule of the 600 CHF? (Information to be provide to those who have been selected)
  
The SIB group teaching will receive 600 CHF per day of course. Under an ideal scenario, the SIB group that is giving the training will reiceive 600 CHF per day of course. This could be done as credits for registration in future SIB events (i.e. [BC2 conference](https://bc2.ch/) or [SIB training courses](https://www.sib.swiss/training/upcoming-training-courses)).
However, we understand it might not be on the best interest of the new trainer to receive these 600 CHF as credits, and the Trainer might prefer to receive the money in cash.
We are willing to have a conversation to find to the best solution for both parties.
