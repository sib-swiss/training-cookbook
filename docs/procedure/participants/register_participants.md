# Register Participants 

The **#Manager** organising the course is responsible for registering applicants. While this can be done only once when the applications exceed the maximum number of participants, it may need to be done in several iterations, starting 1 month prior to the first day of the course. 

## Free courses with no maximum

For courses which are free and have no limit on the maximum number of registered participants, all the students who have applied will be registered. In **#courseadmin**: 

- Find the course entry. 
- Select Students to display all the applicants for the course. 
- Find duplicate entries by visually inspecting the Name and Email fields. If the email is the same, select all but one of the entries and change the Reg. Status from Applied to Removed. 
- Select all students with the Reg. Status Applied. 
- Select the box Select All. 
- Change the Reg. Status to Registered. 
- Select all students with the Reg. Status Registered. 
- Select the box Select All. 
- Export the information for the students using the XLS NAME AND EMAIL button. 

Notifying applicants that they are registered for the course and providing them with practical information (for instance, the Zoom link if the course is streamed). To respect GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), send all mail to yourself and put the email addresses of applicants or registered students in Bcc. 

## Courses with fees

For courses with fees, participants are registered on a first come, first served basis, exceptions may be made to ensure diversity and equity, which may increase the time before your registration is confirmed. The procedure described ensures that the Equality, Diversity, Inclusion Checklist is followed while respecting the mission of the SIB Training group. This requires that the information for the students who have applied for the course in **#courseadmin** be exported: 

### Preselection and number of participants

- Find the course entry. 
- Select Students to display all the applicants for the course. 
- If the trainers have requested that members of their team attend the course, register those first by editing the entry and changing the Reg. Status from Applied to Registered. If they are in the SIB directory (SIB members) change the price to 0 CHF. 
- If the previous instance of the course had a waiting list, register those who registered for the course and were on the waiting list next. 
- Note how many participants are registered. Subtract this number from the maximum number of participants and add 2 students (in case of cancellations). 

### Export excel sheet and sort participants

- Select all students with the Reg. Status applied. 
- Select the box Select All. 
- Export the information for the students using the XLS CUSTOM button. 
- Select the box Select all fields and click on the EXPORT button. While you will not need all the information to register participants, this is the quickest way to pull out the necessary information. 
- An Excel file with all the information for the applicants is generated and automatically downloaded. Open the file in Excel: 
- Sort all entries by Name or Email to see if there are any multiple entries for the same applicant. If there are, keep a single entry (if applicable, the one that contains special comments) and change the Reg. Status from Applied to Removed and highlight the text of the entry in red. 
- Sort all entries by Date inscription. 
- Starting with the first line, change the Reg. Status from Applied to Registered and highlight the text of the entry in green. 
- View the What is your gender?, What is your country of employment? And Is Academic fields for the student you have just marked as registered. Move down the list to register the next line with an applicant of a different gender, bearing in mind that you should register maximum 10% of students from outside Switzerland and try to include participants from industry, until you reach the number of students that you have previously determined can be registered. 
- Filter for all entries with Reg. Status Registered and check in the: 
- What is your gender? field that the female: male ratio is approximately 50:50. This ratio may vary as in some cases the ratio of applicants is biased. 
- What is your country of employment? field that the number of students from outside Switzerland is approximately 10%. This percentage may vary as the proportion of applications from abroad may be significantly higher than those from Switzerland for some courses. 
- What is your career stage? field that the registered participants are primarily PhD candidates and Postdoctoral researcher. 
- If there are many entries with Reg. Status Applied, add an additional column labelled Register next and note the order and specify if this applies to an application from Switzerland or abroad. This will enable the #Admin to take care of the waiting list. 
- Save all changes in the Excel file. 

### Register participants in courseadmin

- Using the Excel file as your reference, update the Reg. Status students who have applied for the course in **#courseadmin**: 
- Starting with all entries with the text in red, find the student and change the Reg. Status from Applied to Removed. 
- For all entries with the text in green, find the student and change the Reg. Status from Applied to Registered. 
- Put remaining students on waiting list:  
    - Select all students with the Reg. Status applied. 
    - Select the box Select All. 
    - Change the Reg. Status to Waiting list. 
    - Save the change. 
- Check the breakdown in Participant status at the top left of the page. 

### Send an e-mail and create payment

Send a mail to students indicating they are registered and provide a link for payment. This is done as follows: 

- Select all students with the Reg. Status Registered. 
- Select the box Select All. 
- Click on the button CREATE PAYMENT â€“ SEND EMAIL. The number of emails will be indicated at the bottom of the page. Note that if there should be an error message if the student does not have Reg. Status registered as this is a condition to send a request for payment. 
- Make sure you receive a copy of the mail sent to students. If that is not the case, contact IT. 
- Update the coordination-tasks-list.xlsx 

## Waiting list 

The **#Manager** organising the course is responsible for notifying applicants that they are on the waiting list. This requires that the information for the students who are on the waiting list for the course in **#courseadmin** be exported: 

- Find the course entry. 
- Select Students to display all the applicants for the course. 
- Select all students with the Reg. Status waiting list. 
- Select the box Select All. 
- Select the box Select All. 
- Export the information for the students using the XLS NAME AND EMAIL button. 
- Notify applicants that they are on the waiting list. To respect GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), send a mail to yourself and put the email addresses of applicants or registered students in Bcc using this template. 
- If needed, send a mail to the #Admin to handle the waiting list and payments. Attach the Excel sheet where you noted the next applicants that should be offered a spot. 

## Cancellations 

The **#Manager** organising the course generally takes care of cancellations. However, if the waiting list and payments are being handled by the #Admin, he/she can also deal with cancellations. 

This is done in **#courseadmin** as follows: 

- Find the course entry. 
- Select Students to display all the applicants for the course. 
- Search for the student's name in the Name field. 
- Change the Reg. Status to cancelled if this is before the registration deadline and absent if this is after the registration deadline. 
- Save the change. 

The student should be notified by mail that his/her registration had been cancelled. 

## Closing registration 

The **#Manager** closes the course to applications in **#courseadmin** . For courses with fees, this is done either when the number of applications largely exceeds the maximum number of participants for the course or at the latest 7 days prior to beginning of the course. For courses which are free and have no limit on the maximum number of registered participants (for instance, lectures on SIB Resources), this can be done 1-2 days prior to the lecture. 

To close registrations, find the course entry and edit the course entry in the following way: 

- Change Web Registration to No (was Yes). This will remove the Apply button in the course description. 
- Change Course reg. status to Closed (was Open). This will change the status of the course displayed in the Upcoming training courses. 
- Indicate on top of the course description that the course is closed. 
- Update the [coordination-tasks-list.xlsx](https://sibcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/patricia_palagi_sib_swiss/EZneXy5SD7lApYqGNzj8vsMB8b67OHWWA3NJgfTcgzvFoA?e=4y8jkN)
