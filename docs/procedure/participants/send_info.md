# Send practical information to registered participants 

The **#Manager** organising the course is responsible for sending the practical information to registered participants. 

Before sending the practical information to registered participants, send your draft mail to the **#Trainer** to check that all that is required is included and there are no last-minute changes.  

Once validated, retrieve the list of names and email addresses of the registered participants from **#courseadmin**. For courses with fees, make sure to include only those who have paid. To respect GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), send the mail to yourself and put the email addresses of the students in Bcc.
