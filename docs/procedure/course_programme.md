# Course programme and planning  
 
## Organize the course plan for the next year  

Once a year, before summer, the **#Admin** downloads all the Short-Term Feedback received in all courses during a period (usually spanning 12 months) and makes a summary of the results. Other metrics from the previous year are also required and these are obtained from **#courseadmin** by the **#Admin**:  

1. Number of times the course was given  
2. Number of course **#Participants** 
3. Number of **#Participants** on the waiting list  

With the summary in hand, the group members (**#Managers** and **#Trainers**) meet to assess whether the courses offered in the previous year meet the community training needs, and whether any changes in either the topics or the frequency of the courses are needed.  

For topics which were the subject of courses given in the previous year, the frequency of the course(s):  

1. May be reduced to once every 2-3 years if the course(s) did not reach the maximum number of **#Participants**.  
2. May likely to remain unchanged, if the course(s) had approximately the maximum number of **#Participants** and did not have a large waiting list.  
3. May be increased if the course(s) had a long waiting list.  

For topics which were not the subject of courses given in the previous year, it is necessary to weigh several factors to decide to add a course on a new topic, for instance:  

1. The top topics selected from the list in the feedback survey take precedence over the topics in the comments.  
2. Does the topic touch on an actual topic of bioinformatics research? For example, while programming in Perl is used in bioinformatics, it has been largely superseded by programming in Python; hence, while there may be a demand for courses in Perl programming, these will not be offered at SIB.  
3. Are there courses available elsewhere which cover the topic, and thus SIB does not need to duplicate efforts?  
4. Is the topic amenable to practical exercises? SIB courses emphasise learning by doing.  
5. Are there trainers at SIB or within the SIB Training community which might be able to give a course on the topic? Is this a topic of high interest that SIB wants to develop and train a new trainer? SIB trainers can attend a first instance of a course given by external trainers to learn to teach. Training in machine learning was in large demand but, as no SIB trainers could give such a course, trainers from ELIXIR were invited to give a first instance of the course.  

Several iterations of discussions among the group members, and individually with several trainers, are needed until the courses, the number of times they will be given in the upcoming year, and the **#Trainers** (at least those closely related to the Training Group) have been decided. All this draft discussion/summary is collected in a Gantt chart format. Once this Gantt chart is stable, the **#Managers** can go ahead to organise the course plan.  

Along the year, other courses not foreseen in this initial plan can be included in the programme. For instance, the Training Group can receive requests from other SIB groups to organise a specific course. Or in the case a new and highly demanded topic is identified, the group can loop up for SIB members who could potentially teach them.  
 

## Annual Program  

The process of creating the annual program of courses has several steps, and this process usually starts before the summer, and ends in October when the programme is available online in the SIB Training website. Not necessarily all courses will be displayed on the website all at once in October (often it depends on the trainers' calendar), but our aim is to have at least a handle in the program for most courses that we plan to organise, so that all in the Training group know the general plan and we can add or remove courses as we see fit.  

Itâ€™s important to have this programme well ahead of time so that stakeholders (**#Trainers**, **#Managers**, course **#Participants**, can mark the courses in their agendas, and for the good of the SIB Training visibility (our image, our recognition).  


The main steps of this process are:  
    - Identify the most needed and requested courses (see [Identify and assess training needs](https://sib-training.gitlab.io/sib-training-cookbook/topic/training_needs/))  
    - Assign or search for teachers who can teach these courses  
    - Create a Gantt chart with these courses over one year so that all involved can have a single view of which courses are pre-requisites for other courses, and to make sure that the same courses are well spread along the year, etc  
    - Define the dates for these courses together with the **#Trainers**, making sure the **#Trainers** who teach in many courses are not overwhelmed in parts of the year, the courses are well spread along the year, etc.  

This Gantt chart will then be improved along many iterations with **#Trainers** and **#Managers**. Once the Gantt chart is well developed, the **#Admin** moves the courses that were decided, with dates and trainers to the Working spreadsheet of the Year. The Training Group Leader then assigns one **#Manager** per course, who will then start the organisation.  

For each course, the **#Manager** will then enter the course description in #courseadmin such that the courses for the upcoming year are displayed in the [Upcoming training courses page](https://www.sib.swiss/training/upcoming-training-courses).  

The planned courses are added into the Outlook shared group Calendar.
