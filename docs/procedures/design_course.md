## Defining the course  

Usually, a course project starts with an idea of a teaching goal. It starts as a general topic and little by little Manager and Trainer work together to define Learning outcomes, Overview of the course, prerequisites, audience for whom this is targeted - for courseadmin.  

Manager ask Trainer if helpers are needed, learning experiences (exercises), content the experiences, content for exam. Parts are in the course description and others are related to content. Check the feedback of previous instances – for teaching and logistics.  

The Manager may provide tips on how to deliver courses, for instance based on the [Train-the-Trainer](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/ELIXIR-EXCELERATE-TtT) course content.  

When designing a new course, it should be defined as [Open and FAIR](../topics/FAIR-training-flowchart/flowchart_description.md) from the beginning.  

## Create new content for the course  

A new course requires a lot of work to create the course content, never underestimate this.  

1. In case of collaborative teaching, the Manager organizes a meeting with the **#Trainer(s)** to make content creation possible, in particular to:  

    i. be in line with the target audience, learning objectives, course level, and prerequisites,  

    ii. split up the content in an equitable manner between **#Trainer(s)** while ensuring that the transitions will be smooth,  

    iii. avoid overlapping content with what the other **#Trainer(s)** of the course will teach and the content of other SIB courses on the topic,  

    iv. remind **#Trainer(s)** of good practises concerning copyright by referring them to:  Schütz et al. (2021). [Copyright Guidelines - How to acknowledge and be acknowledged in training material](https://zenodo.org/record/5841604#.ZD8VR-xByX0) (1.0*). Zenodo.  
    
    v. encourage **#Trainer(s)** to make their material open and FAIR,  

    vi. Discuss the exam that the **#Trainer(s)** will give (See more about [Exam options](../topics/ECTS_exam.md)).  

2. The **#Trainer(s)** designs the structure of the course according to the length, level and format.  

3. The **#Trainer(s)** makes sure the course contents fit the duration of the course. Specifically, the #**Trainer(s)** estimate the time needed both for teaching and for hands-on exercises (including corrections).  

4. Jump to the “Common process” section.  

## Improve and adapt the content of the course  

This is the situation when the course material has already been created (by the current **#Trainer(s)** or by another **#Trainer(s)**) and is going to be reused for further course occurrences.  

1. The **#Trainer(s)** reads again the last feedback and considers taking the comments into account when possible.  

2. The Manager ensures that at least one #Trainer has access to the source material from the previous course iteration, as well as access rights to the Git repository (if necessary). The access to the SIB Github must be done by one of the IT admins (see reference in [OneNote](https://sibcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/r/personal/patricia_palagi_sib_swiss/Documents/TrainingGroup-Shared/References/Minutes/Training?d=w62777f8411f64078a386712e61b0e9b1&csf=1&web=1&e=hepCBK)).  

3. The **#Trainer(s)** ensures good data management of the content using version control of the course material, either manually or even better, using a versioning system (for instance in GitHub).  

4. The **#Trainer(s)** modifies the content based on his own notes and the short-term evaluation (See section: Create new content for the course in this chapter).  

    - Adapt the general Learning Outcomes, Schedule (flow), Course material (slides or exercises).  
    - Update the Materials of the course. This is done by the #Trainer, who decides to add or remove a specific lesson.  

5. Jump to the “Common process” section.  

## Common process

The next steps must be completed for both new and existing courses:  

1. The #**Trainer(s)** tests the material (slides and exercises) and provides guidelines on how to test it.  

2. The **#Trainer(s)** communicates with the Manager about the software / package(s) to be installed in advance by the participants and the possible instructions, and assignment preparation (Send practical information to registered participants)  

3. If an exam is proposed (see [Exam](../topics/ECTS_exam.md)), the **#Trainer(s)** prepares an exam corresponding to the content and matching the number of ECTS (See [ECTS credits and Exam](../topics/ECTS_exam.md)).  

4. The **#Trainer(s)** make the course materials available at least few days before the course and inform the Manager who will share this information with the course Participants. If the course is a repetition, then the course materials should be available before (see [Make course materials open and FAIR](../topics/FAIR-training-flowchart/flowchart_description.md)).
