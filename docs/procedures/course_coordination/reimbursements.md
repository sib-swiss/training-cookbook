**Expenses**: always add title and date of course.  

Main meals (breakfast if leaving before 7 am, lunch and dinner) are reimbursed on the basis of supporting documents. The maximum amount reimbursed is CHF 10 breakfast, CHF 30 lunch, CHF 40 dinner (this is a maximum, not a fixed sum). Note that it is not possible to offset one meal against another, e.g. spending CHF 20 on lunch and CHF 50 on dinner. <- the rules have now changed, and this applies to staff trainers and invited trainers and speakers. 

Examples of reimbursement: 

- Reimbursement to SIB trainers when teaching in their work city or in another one 
- Reimbursement to external trainers when teaching in their work city or in another one 
- Reimbursement to SIB managers 

 

Note: There is no reimbursement for a trainer (SIB or non-SIB) when s/he teaches in the same city s/he works. 

 

In order to get reimbursed, SIB trainers can directly ask for a refund from the online platform. Otherwise, trainers have to fill an expense sheet and send it to Admin. Admin then controls the expense sheet, add the title of the course and the date and send it to Patricia.
