## Feedback Form

The Manager can find here the steps to create a feedback form and share with the students and **#Trainer(s)**

Feedback Guide – Sharepoint 

## Create and edit the Feedback Form 
1. [Duplicate the feedback template](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=KewaGuOxtEGL2iiKlpme_4AvrTClUXVPucBPHY8citJURVBRMVhSWjNJVkMyOUdEVzg3WlJTVVMyMCQlQCN0PWcu&sharetoken=yN8Blcb0h7la2vBcFJrx)

You can copy paste the link on your browser or take the link from the coordination task list (Line 25, column A) 
Once you duplicate it, “Duplicate this form to use as your own”. It is going to be saved in your own Documents. 

2. Rename the suvey with the name of the course.

3. Set up a starting and ending date/time to fill in the form 

Settings -->Options for responses --> start or end date 

## Collect answers by obtaining the link to collect answers 

To obtain the Link to Collect answers, click on Share (Top Right corner), and you will get the link to send to the students. (Select Shorten URL).
The responses will be gathered on the same file, on the second tab “Responses”.
There you can click on “Open Excel” 

Once you open the excel file, rename it to the same name as the feedback Form 

This excel will be saved in your own Documents. 

##  Error in the excel file

In case there is an error in the excel file, please follow [these steps](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-get-missing-data-in-forms-9fb98299-4dcc-41a4-bb29-34a9c3daf8cc). Normally when getting less columns than (to Y) is because the excel file got corrupted and a new one should be generated. 

## Close Feedback and Share with others.  

Share link of Form and results on [CoordinationTaskList](https://sibcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/patricia_palagi_sib_swiss/EZneXy5SD7lApYqGNzj8vsMB8b67OHWWA3NJgfTcgzvFoA?e=4y8jkN)

Once the feedback is closed (not receiving answers anymore), then in the file [CoordinationTaskList](https://sibcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/patricia_palagi_sib_swiss/EZneXy5SD7lApYqGNzj8vsMB8b67OHWWA3NJgfTcgzvFoA?e=4y8jkN): 

Line 25 of your course --> add the link to the Form 

Line 27 of your course --> add the link to the Excel results 

Share the Form link steps: Click on the settings of the results (..) “Collaborate or Duplicate” 

## Send feedback results to the Trainers? 
 
For Courses with internal SIB trainers: we can give the link to the form itself with the answers, in case they wish to visualize the feedback results as soon as the course finishes. 
(Done by the Manager) 

- Click on the settings of the results (..) “Collaborate or Duplicate” 
- Copy the first link “Share to collaborate” 

The Manager can send it directly to the Trainer (if the trainer belongs to SIB, will have access to the raw results and can visualize all the answers) 

Also, once the feedback is closed, Manager informs Admin that he/she can share the last version of the feedback in pdf and a summary of questions 10, 11 and 12 (extracted from the excel) with the Trainers. The fille name will have the following format: YYYYMMDD_5lettersCode_feedback.pdf. 

For Courses with external trainers:  

Once the feedback is closed, Manager informs Admin that he can share the last version of the feedback in pdf and a summary of questions 10, 11 and 12 (extracted from the excel or from a print screen in the form) with the Trainers. See [Administrative Tasks](admin_tasks.md). 

Upload the feedback results in the ELIXIR Metrics Database 
(Done by Admin)
