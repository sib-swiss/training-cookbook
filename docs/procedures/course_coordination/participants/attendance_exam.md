## Attendance 

For the **in-person courses**, for each day of course, the Trainer circulates the attendance list among the Participants to collect their signature. At the end of the course, the Trainer sends a copy (an image or a pdf of the scan) to the Manager who will then update the courseadmin indicating any absences. The copy of the attendance list should be stored in OneDrive, in the folder dedicated to the course.  

For the streamed courses, the only difference is that either the Trainer or the Manager will make screenshot(s), preferably at different time points during the course, of the #Zoom participant’s list per day of course. To do this: 

Click Participants to view the full list of participants 

Use prtsc (F10; Cmd + Shift + 4 on Mac) or a tool such as FSCapture (on Windows) to make a screenshot 

If the list of participants is longer than the height of the screen, you will need to scroll down and take another screenshot. 

The Manager will then update the courseadmin indicating any absences. The screenshot(s) should be stored in OneDrive, in the folder dedicated to the course. 

 

 

Sign in to the Zoom desktop client and start a meeting as the host, co-host, or alternative host. 

In the host controls, click Participants to open the full list of participants. 

In the bottom-right corner of the Participants panel, click  … , then click Show Not Joined Participants.  
 

Within the 2 weeks following the end of a course, see [Design the course](../../../procedures/design_course.md) for the rules on exams, the Trainer sends the results of the exams to the Manager and #Admin, who will then update the courseadmin with pass or fail.  

 

 

If the Trainer provides individual feedback for each Participant, for instance on the results expected or on the code, etc, the Trainer will either send this information directly to the Participant or to the Manager who will then send this information directly to the Participant. Both the Trainer and Manager will need to agree in advance on who’s going to send this information.  


### Make sure the participants know the formalities for the assessment – Exam 

Generally, the assessment is linked to the obtaining of ECTS credits. Most PhD students need these credits to validate their studies to their PhD doctoral school. (See [Design the course](../../../procedures/design_course.md)).

**Before the course**

If the course advertised on the SIB Training website indicates ECTS credits can be obtained, The Manager reminds the **#Trainer(s)** before the course that an assessment needs to take place. 

**During the course**

One important aspect the Manager needs to take care of during the course is to make sure the participants know the formalities for the assessment for courses which propose an evaluation at the end.  

During the course, the Manager or the **#Trainer(s)** announces or reminds the audience of the possibility to take an evaluation to get credits (priority will be given to PhD students). His/her role is to make sure participants know how they will be assessed (onsite, online, offline, deadlines, format....) and determine approximately how many participants will be taking the exam. 

**After the course**

At the end of the course and after the course, participants will be reminded by the Manager or the Trainer(s) on the formalities of assessment.  

**#Trainer(s)** provide the students with the exam and answer any questions they may have. 

As quickly as possible and no later than a week, the **#Trainer(s)** evaluate the exams, provide feedback to the students (optional) and give the Manager the results of the exam (participant name, pass/failed). 


## Verifying Participant Presence in Online Training
For online or streamed courses, Zoom is typically used to conduct the sessions. To ensure accurate tracking of participants, follow these steps:

**1. Taking Screenshots of Participants**
The course coordinator can take screenshots of the list of participants during the training session and save them in the course folder for future reference. This provides a quick visual record of attendance at a specific moment during the session.

**2. Generating a Zoom Attendance Report**
A more detailed and automated report can be obtained directly from Zoom. To access this, follow these steps:

    1. Log in to your Zoom Account

        - Open a web browser and navigate to Zoom's login page.

        - Log in with your Zoom account credentials.

    2. Navigate to the Reports Section

        - On the left-hand menu, under the Personal section, click on Reports.

    3. Access Meeting and Webinar History

        - In the Reports menu, click on Usage Reports.

        - Select Meeting and Webinar History. This section allows you to view a history of all meetings and webinars held over a specified time period.

    4. Select the Course Time Frame

        - Set the appropriate date range for the course session you want to track.

        - A list of meetings that occurred within the selected period will be displayed.

    5. View Participants

        - Find the meeting corresponding to your course and click on the Participants link for that meeting.

        - Select Show Unique Users to get a clear list of all unique participants in the meeting.

    6. Export the Participant Report

        - Click Export to download a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file containing the detailed participant report.

        - The CSV file will include the names of all participants, along with the duration each user was connected to the meeting.

This report provides an accurate and time-stamped record of participant attendance, ensuring that you can verify who attended and for how long.
