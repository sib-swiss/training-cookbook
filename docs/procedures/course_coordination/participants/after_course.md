## Update courseadmin (after a course) 

 

1. Manager change the status “Applied” to “Waiting list”. 
To do this in courseadmin, select the participants and in the section “Update selected”, click on “Reg. Status” and choose “Waiting list” before saving. 
2. Manager (possibly also Admin) updates the courseadmin with absences or very late cancellations and tag them as “Absent”. 
To do this in courseadmin, select the participants and in the section “Update selected”, click on “Reg. Status” and choose “Absent” before saving. 
3. Manager (possibly also Admin) updates the courseadmin by indicating the participants who have successfully passed the exam and thus are eligible to receive a ”Certificate of Achievement”. 
To do this in courseadmin, select the participants and in the section “Update selected”, click on “Exam” and choose “Passed” before saving the update. 
You can also attribute the status “Failed” to those who did not succeed, but it has no function for us now. 
4. Manager informs Admin when this process is done, meaning Admin can: 
- Start the reimbursement process 
- Send the certificates (see [Certificates](certificate.md)) 

 

**Note about reimbursements:** The status “Cancelled” is eligible for reimbursement. Only motivated cancellations (the most frequent being sickness) are eligible for reimbursement when informed after the cancellation deadline. Cancellations for other duties (like an unexpected meeting) will usually be tagged as “Absent”. This greatly simplifies the process for Admin.
