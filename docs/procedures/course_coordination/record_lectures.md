## Record Lectures

**Before the course**

- Manager makes sure he/she has the link and the admin right to host the meeting. In the event he/she cannot be present at the event start, the Manager will communicate the information to the Trainer(s). 

**During the course** 

- At the beginning of the session, the Trainer or Manager informs the participants about the course recording. 
- Manager makes sure the course is being recorded. For this, the Manager either activates the automatic recording in the [Zoom meeting setup](https://us02web.zoom.us/profile/setting), or he does it manually at the beginning of the session. Local recording is advised as cloud recording has small storage capacity. Consult SIB Training Coordinators in case of issue(s).  

**After the course**

- At the end of the course, the recording is stopped, and the video file automatically processed and saved in a new sub-folder named according to the date and event name (20xx-xx-xx hh.mm.ss Title). All the generated sub-folders are in the Zoom folder on the local machine. 
- The Manager asks the Trainer for confirmation that the recording can be processed (in case of technical issues). 
- Manager (or Trainer if recording was done by him/her) locates the mp4 file in the Zoom folder of his/her local computer. The recording is sent to the Manager if processed on his/her computer. 
- Manager sends the file (e.g. via [SWITCHfile sender](https://filesender.switch.ch/)) or provides the path (if put on OneDrive) to Admin and gives instructions so that he/she can process the video(s) accurately, in particular Manager will inform if some parts need to be cut. 
- Admin informs Manager when done. 

 

## Share Video 

The Manager organising the course is responsible for putting the raw video on OneDrive. The Manager also views this video to note the exact start and end time for the sections of the video that should be removed. Doing so shortly after the course, it can be done quickly by using the fast forward option to jump to the transition points in the course. The instructions for editing the video are provided to the Admin.  

The Admin edits the raw video and puts the edited version on OneDrive. The Manager reviews the edited version to ensure that there are no funnies, and it is ready to be shared on YouTube. 

The Manager prepares the information required to upload the edited version to YouTube according to the instructions found here: [YouTube_Upload_Instructions-for-contributors](https://sibcloud.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/T-COMM/EasfsyE0UZFIn1z-NTd2bjcBtKgO9e7KXQ1iFGGzSG9naA?email=training-group%40sib.swiss&e=4%3a7nZ99U&at=9) bearing in mind the following: 

- **Title**: This is the same as the title of the course. However, if you have split the original video in several videos, you will want to include (1 of n), (2 of n), ...at the end of the title to indicate that these are all a part of the same series of videos. 
- **Description**: This consists of: 
    - A short paragraph summarizing the contents, taken from the Overview section of the course description 
    - The date the video was recorded, with the format “The video was recorded live during the course on ...” 
    - The target audience, starting with “Target audience:” followed by a summary taken from the Audience section 
    - The speaker, starting with “Speaker:” followed by the speaker’s name and brief description (head of group, etc.) 
    - The contact information, starting with “Any question about this talk? Contact” followed by the e-mail address of the speaker or resource 
    - The license which applies:   “This video is available under the creative commons license [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)" 
    - Generic tags which apply, starting with “Tags 'génériques' des in silico (n): webinar, bioinformatics,” (where n is the number of tags) 
    - Tags specific to the course, starting with “Tags 'spécifiques au webinar' (n): training,” (where n is the number of tags) 
    - The video should be linked to others when it is part of a series or when it differs considerably from that of the last course instance (for instance, it presents novel aspects which are not found in the previous video for the course).  

- When a collection of videos is generated after a course, it is nice to have a playlist containing all videos of one course. 

## Edit Video

The Admin edits the video using the Youtube Editor Studio. Based on the timing of the section decided by the Manager, Admin cuts and arrange the video for it to be ready for publication on youtube. Once it is done, Admin sends the link to the videos to the Manager for validation.  

## Publishing Video

Done by the Admin

1. Click on the camera Logo, select “Mettre en ligne une vidéo”, then slide the video file or select it directly from your folder.  

2. To prepare the vignette, use the template (See link in [OneNote](https://sibcloud-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patricia_palagi_sib_swiss/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B62777f84-11f6-4078-a386-712e61b0e9b1%7D&action=edit&wd=target%28Quick+reference.one%7C68e8b806-dd4d-4fef-9583-89b8846c75f3%2FCookbook+Links%7C888376a5-cf93-40bc-bb57-76883509eb73%2F%29&wdorigin=703)) and modify the training information. Then, follow :  File -> export -> png, dimensions 720 x 405.

3. Copy/Paste the title and the description in the corresponding fields on youtube (Be careful when pasting links that are in the description, you will have to paste them separatly). Then, import the vignette you prepared before.  

4. Select the playlist “Training in bioinformatics” and if applicable others. If you want to select other playlists, a check-up with SIB Communication Officer is required. You can then save the selection.  

5. For the audience, select  « Non, elle n’est pas conçue pour les enfants » 

6. Clink on “PLUS” to access more option and insert the tags (Must be separated by a comma in the word document sent by the Manager for them to appear correctly on youtube. After that, add the recording date and click on “SUIVANT” as all the other options are set by default.  

7. In order to add video suggestions in the video, click on “Ajouter” in the “Ajouter des fiches” section.  
Click on « + fiche » -> vidéo -> sélectionner la vidéo dans la liste. Then, insert the timing in the field ”Fiche Vidéo” or slide the blue cursor in the timeline (We usually put 30/40 seconds after the beginning or before the end). Multiples ”fiches” can be added.  

8. The last step is the publication. 3 options are given by youtube: 
s- **Private**: Only accessible to people connected on the SIB account 
- **Not listed**: Only accessible by people having the link. It won’t appear on the youtube channel. This is the mode the video are in when Admin send them to Manager for validation. 
- **Public**: Is available to anyone and the followers will receive a notification after the publication.  

9. Even if the video is in public mode, modifiying it is still possible in the Youtube studio.
