 

## In-person courses  

 
Depending on whether the Manager is onsite or not, Manager or the **#Trainer(s)** will determine beforehand (if on site) the location of plugs and the need for extension cables. They will also determine if the layout of the classroom must be reorganized such that all Participants have a direct view of the trainer and the screen.
