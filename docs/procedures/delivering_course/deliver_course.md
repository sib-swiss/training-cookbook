# Deliver the course  

 
 

The Manager organising the course is responsible for checking that the Trainer is ready to:  

 
 

1. deliver the course (e.g. the process of offering a course to participants) on the defined date and at the location specified, and  

2. evaluate the participants by an exam to those wishing to obtain ECTS credits.  

 
 

The Manager will decide together with the Trainer what are the best methods to deliver the course, in which educational content is conveyed from instructor to participants. The Manager will discuss with Trainer whether they need additional means of communicating with the students.  

 
 

Note that:  

1. googledocs have been replaced with shared Word files to share information with the Participants,  

2. the feedback forms in the Moodle have been replaced with the Forms files to share information with the Admin. (See [Feedback Form](../course_coordination/feedback.md)).
