| Begginer              | A course introducing a given topic. For instance, **First steps in Unix** or **Introduction to Shiny R**. Note that the former has no prerequisites for learners. However, the latter requires that leaners have an intermediate to advanced knowledge of R, but no prior experience with Shiny is expected, and thus it is a beginner level in Shiny.    |
| Intermediate          | Several prerequisites for learners.   |
| Advanced              | A course many prerequisites for learners.  |
