## Design, Create, Improve and Evaluate a course 

E-learning courses follow a similar procedure to SIB Training courses (Design, Create, Improve and Evaluate a course). 

### Design the course 

For each new e-learning course, the topic, audience, competencies, learning objectives, and prerequisites should be established. 

- Competencies: A competency is *an observable ability of any professional*. A competency can be defined as a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes. It is observable, so its acquisition can be validated objectively. Competencies are currently being used only for e-leaning courses. 

- Each learning objective must align with a specific competency.

- Each task must ensure that the learning objective is met when completed.

E-learning courses on SIB resources generally follow a SIB Training course on the resource, for which a course description exists. 
 
The structure of the course should be designed with the Trainer according to the length and level.

Each module should not take more than 1 hour to complete, as the **#Participant's** concentration begins to wane after 45 minutes. 

### Create the course 

E-learning courses follow a similar procedure to SIB Training courses (Course material page). 

The e-learning course is created in the SIB Bioinformatics Training and [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics E-learning Portal](https://edu.sib.swiss/), using the [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) LMS Learning Management System and [H5P](https://h5p.org/) for interactivity. A template is used for e-learning to ensure the same look and feel for most of the SIB e-learning courses. 

### Improve and adapt the content of the course 

The contents of e-learning courses on SIB resource are reviewed on a yearly basis and adapted to any modifications made. For example, changes to the URL of the resource or a complete redesign of the home page require the e-learning course content to be adapted. 

The content of the e-learning course is also improved based on the feedback form.
