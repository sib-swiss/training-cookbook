## Create the E-learning

E-learning courses follow a similar procedure to SIB Training courses (Course material page). 

The e-learning course is created in the SIB Bioinformatics Training and [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics E-learning Portal](https://edu.sib.swiss/), using the [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) LMS Learning Management System and [H5P](https://h5p.org/) for interactivity. A template is used for e-learning to ensure the same look and feel for most of the SIB e-learning courses. 

## Improve and adapt the content of the course 

The contents of e-learning courses on SIB resource are reviewed on a yearly basis and adapted to any modifications made. For example, changes to the URL of the resource or a complete redesign of the home page require the e-learning course content to be adapted. 

The content of the e-learning course is also improved based on the feedback form.
